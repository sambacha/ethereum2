A timeline of all the major milestones, forks, and updates to the Ethereum blockchain.

### What are forks?

Changes to the rules of the Ethereum protocol which often include planned technical upgrades.

The Altair upgrade is the first scheduled upgrade for the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain). It is expected to go live in 2021. It will add support for "sync committees", which can enable light clients, and will bring inactivity and slashing penalties up to their full values.

The London upgrade introduced [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), which reformed the transaction fee market, along with changes to how gas refunds are handled and the [Ice Age](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#ice-age) schedule.

The [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/) needed 16384 deposits of 32 staked ETH to ship securely. This happened on November 27, meaning the Beacon Chain started producing blocks on December 1, 2020. This is an important first step in achieving the [Eth2 vision](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/).

The Muir Glacier fork introduced a delay to the [difficulty bomb](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#difficulty-bomb). Increases in block difficulty of the [proof-of-work](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) consensus mechanism threatened to degrade the usability of Ethereum by increasing wait times for sending transactions and using dapps.

The Spurious Dragon fork was the second response to the denial of service (DoS) attacks on the network (September/October 2016) including:

-   tuning opcode pricing to prevent future attacks on the network.
-   enabling “debloat” of the blockchain state.
-   adding replay attack protection.

The DAO fork was in response to the [2016 DAO attack](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists) where an insecure [DAO](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#dao) contract was drained of over 3.6 million ETH in a hack. The fork moved the funds from the faulty contract to a [new contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf4ed7b27f1d666546e30d74d50d173d20bca754) with a single function: withdraw. Anyone who lost funds could withdraw 1 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens in their wallets.

This course of action was voted on by the Ethereum community. Any ETH holder was able to vote via a transaction on [a voting platform](http://v1.carbonvote.com/). The decision to fork reached over 85% of the votes.

Some miners refused to fork because the DAO incident wasn't a defect in the protocol. They went on to form [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/).

The frontier thawing fork lifted the 5,000 [gas](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#gas) limit per [block](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#block) and set the default gas price to 51 [gwei](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#gwei). This allowed for transactions – transactions require 21,000 gas.

Frontier was a live, but barebone implementation of the Ethereum project. It followed the successful Olympic testing phase. It was intended for technical users, specifically developers. [Blocks](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#block) had a [gas](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#gas) limit of 5,000. This ‘thawing’ period enabled miners to start their operations and for early adopters to install their clients without having to ‘rush’.

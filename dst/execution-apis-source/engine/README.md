# Engine JSON-RPC API

The Engine JSON-RPC API is a collection of methods that all execution clients implement.
This interface allows the communication between consensus and execution layers of the two-component post-Merge Ethereum Client.

This API is in *active development* and currently [specified as a markdown document](./specification.md).
A schema will follow once the specification stabilizes.

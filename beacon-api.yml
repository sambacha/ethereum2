  title: Eth Beacon Node API
  description: >
    API specification for the beacon node, which enables users to query and
    participate in Ethereum 2.0 phase 0 beacon chain.


    All requests by default send and receive JSON, and as such should have
    either or both of the "Content-Type: application/json"

    and "Accept: application/json" headers.  In addition, some requests can
    return data in the SSZ format.  To indicate that SSZ

    data is required in response to a request the header "Accept:
    application/octet-stream" should be sent.  Note that only a subset

    of requests can respond with data in SSZ format; these are noted in each
    individual request.


    API endpoints are individually versioned.  As such, there is no direct
    relationship between all v1 endpoints, all v2 endpoints,

    _etc._ and no such relationship should be inferred.  All JSON responses
    return the requested data under a `data` key in the top

    level of their response.  Additional metadata may or may not be present in
    other keys at the top level of the response, dependent

    on the endpoint.  The rules that require an increase in version number are
    as follows:

      - no field that is listed in an endpoint shall be removed without an increase in the version number
      - no field that is listed in an endpoint shall be altered in terms of format (_e.g._ from a string to an array) without an
        increase in the version number

    Note that it is possible for a field to be added to an endpoint's data or
    metadata without an increase in the version number.

        Instructs the beacon node to use the components of the
        `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock` to construct and publish a 

        `SignedBeaconBlock` by swapping out the `transactions_root` for the
        corresponding full list of `transactions`.

        The beacon node should broadcast a newly constructed `SignedBeaconBlock`
        to the beacon network,

        to be included in the beacon chain. The beacon node is not required to
        validate the signed

        `BeaconBlock`, and a successful response (20X) only indicates that the
        broadcast has been

        successful. The beacon node is expected to integrate the new block into
        its state, and

        therefore validate the block internally, however blocks which fail the
        validation are still

        broadcast but a different status code is returned (202). Pre-Bellatrix,
        this endpoint will accept 

        a `SignedBeaconBlock`.

      description: >-
        Requests the beacon node to provide a set of attestation duties, which
        should be performed by validators, for a particular epoch.

        Duties should only need to be checked once per epoch, however a chain
        reorganization (of > MIN_SEED_LOOKAHEAD epochs) could occur, resulting
        in a change of duties. For full safety, you should monitor head events
        and confirm the dependent root in this response matches:

        - event.previous_duty_dependent_root when
        `compute_epoch_at_slot(event.slot) == epoch`

        - event.current_duty_dependent_root when
        `compute_epoch_at_slot(event.slot) + 1 == epoch`

        - event.block otherwise


        The dependent_root value is `get_block_root_at_slot(state,
        compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch - 1) - 1)` or the genesis block root
        in the case of underflow.

        Note that there is no guarantee that the beacon node will use the
        supplied fee

        recipient when creating a block proposal, so on receipt of a proposed
        block the

        validator should confirm that it finds the fee recipient within the
        block

        acceptable before signing it.


        Also note that requests containing currently inactive or unknown
        validator

        indices will be accepted, as they may become active at a later epoch.

    ValidatorStatus:
      description: >
        Possible statuses:

        - **pending_initialized** - When the first deposit is processed, but not
        enough funds are available (or not yet the end of the first epoch) to
        get validator into the activation queue.

        - **pending_queued** - When validator is waiting to get activated, and
        have enough funds etc. while in the queue, validator activation epoch
        keeps changing until it gets to the front and make it through
        (finalization is a requirement here too).

        - **active_ongoing** - When validator must be attesting, and have not
        initiated any exit.

        - **active_exiting** - When validator is still active, but filed a
        voluntary request to exit.

        - **active_slashed** - When validator is still active, but have a
        slashed status and is scheduled to exit.

        - **exited_unslashed** - When validator has reached reguler exit epoch,
        not being slashed, and doesn't have to attest any more, but cannot
        withdraw yet.

        - **exited_slashed** - When validator has reached reguler exit epoch,
        but was slashed, have to wait for a longer withdrawal period.

        - **withdrawal_possible** - After validator has exited, a while later is
        permitted to move funds, and is truly out of the system.

        - **withdrawal_done** - (not possible in phase0, except slashing full
        balance) - actually having moved funds away

        get validator into the activation queue.

        - **pending_queued** - When validator is waiting to get activated, and
        have enough funds etc. while in the queue, validator activation epoch
        keeps changing until it gets to the front and make it through
        (finalization is a requirement here too).

        - **active_ongoing** - When validator must be attesting, and have not
        initiated any exit.

        - **active_exiting** - When validator is still active, but filed a
        voluntary request to exit.

        - **active_slashed** - When validator is still active, but have a
        slashed status and is scheduled to exit.

        - **exited_unslashed** - When validator has reached reguler exit epoch,
        not being slashed, and doesn't have to attest any more, but cannot
        withdraw yet.

        - **exited_slashed** - When validator has reached reguler exit epoch,
        but was slashed, have to wait for a longer withdrawal period.

        - **withdrawal_possible** - After validator has exited, a while later is
        permitted to move funds, and is truly out of the system.

        - **withdrawal_done** - (not possible in phase0, except slashing full
        balance) - actually having moved funds away
